Hint

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

    For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

 

Constraints:

    0 <= x <= 231 - 1

class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        // Edge case: the square root of 0 is 0
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        
        int left = 1, right = x, ans = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // Avoid potential overflow
            
            // Check if mid*mid is less than or equal to x
            if (mid <= x / mid) {
                ans = mid;         // mid is a potential answer
                left = mid + 1;    // Try for a larger value
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;   // mid*mid is too large, search in the left half
            }
        }
        
        return ans;  // ans will hold the largest mid such that mid*mid <= x
    }
};
